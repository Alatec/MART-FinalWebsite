        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h2>The Introduction</h2>
        <p>All credit goes to our founder Eugene Arik; who has a terrible habit of binge drinking on the weekends.
        One night, during one of his benders, he went to the fridge looking for something to eat. Drunk people aren't known for their intelligent choices and Gene is no different.
        In his stupor, he was convinced that his swordsmanship was on par with Inigo Montoya and had been wielding a table knife for the better part of the night.
        While searching the fridge, he came across some left over pizza and proceded to skewer it with his knife. This was when he realized that he had just invented pizza kebaps.</p>
        <h2>The Exposition</h2>
        <p>This became his life's work. Over the next couple years, Gene sobered up and became a force for good. He started small by making pizza kebaps and giving them out to homeless shelters.
        Word began to spread about this crazy new invention. Pizza kebaps became news nationwide and finally put townsburg on the map. Unfortunately, once the novelty wore off people realized that putting
        pizza on a stick complicated what was already one of the most convient finger foods and quickly abandoned the idea.</p>
        <h2>The Climax</h2>
        <p>Undetered, Gene worked tirelessly on promoting his invention. Every day, he was trying new and increasingly profound things to attempt to advertise this culinary masterpiece.
        However, since the media hubbub had died down, Gene just couldn't promote this well enough to catch back on. In a last ditch effort, Gene decided he needed to go back this idea's roots.
        He contacted Arthur Bolat of Bolat Distilling, the company the produced the whiskey that let to the bender that created pizza kebaps.
        </p>
        <h2>The Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Gene and Arthur discussed at length the terms of their collaboration and eventually settled on deal that Gene thought was fair. Unfortunately for Gene, nothing was in writing. None of it. He had no proof that pizza kebaps were his idea
        Arthur Bolat, being the successful business man he is, knew this and created Mr. Bolat Pizza and Kebaps. With the entire advertising power of his distillery brand, Mr. Bolat soon became a household name.
        Soon there will be a Mr. Bolat near you.</p>
